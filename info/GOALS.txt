BUGS:
	Crashes when:
		'ask' with no dicts or with dicts
		'rask' look above
		'exit' when there is something to save

ISSUES:
	When no dictionaries present and the user defines something, defs are lost
	When an empty dict is opened, no error message is shown, but it still says that are no dicts
	When defining a def, the user is stuck in the continuous input mode
